"""
HADDOCK3 ternary-complex docking for novel CRBN-glue candidates vs PPIL4.

Follow-on to 04_vina_dock_candidates_(Ryan).py (which Vina-screens
candidates into CRBN's pocket and ranks them by affinity, since -- unlike
Thalidomide -- no crystal structure exists for them). This script reads that
screening ranking, derives CRBN-side AIR restraints from each top candidate's
docked-ligand contact residues (in place of thalidomide's crystallographic
contacts), and runs the full (slow) HADDOCK3 ternary docking against PPIL4,
using the same real RRM-domain interface restraints as before (see
ppil4_pocket_residues() below), for only the top TOP_FRACTION of candidates.

Run in the haddock3 venv:
    source .venv-haddock3/bin/activate
